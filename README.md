# Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a weather prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict the next day's weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, etc.) based on historical weather data. This project uses machine learning models and techniques to analyze and forecast weather conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: This is used to run the code and visualize results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's weather prediction dataset. It contains historical weather data from various cities, including temperature, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, and more.

### Dataset Features:
- **DATE**: The date of the weather record.
- **CITY**: The city for which weather data is recorded.
- **Temperature**: The daily average temperature.
- **Humidity**: The humidity level for the day.
- **Precipitation**: The precipitation (rainfall, snow, etc.) recorded.
- **Cloud Cover**: The percentage of cloud coverage for the day.
- **Wind Speed**: The speed of the wind for the day.
- **Other weather-related features**.

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and clean the data.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform data visualization to understand trends and patterns.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select the most relevant features for prediction.
   
4. **Model Building**:
   - Train various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize model performance.
